## Create beautiful charts using real data powered by [Recharts library](https://github.com/recharts/recharts)

Currently available are:
- Line Chart
- Bar Chart
- Area Chart

You can supply data from either a file (csv/json) or from a URL.

## Setup

1. Drag one of the chart components onto the canvas
2. Supply a data-source. Either a file (csv/json) or a URL
3. Use the „debug“-mode to show your data as a table and easily see which columns to create.
4. Use the Array-Control to add the chart-items called either Lines, Areas or Bars - depending on the component you are using.
5. Use the other controls to customize the component  further.
6. The components come with a preset of 5 shared colors - this means that they all use the same theme. Just replace those colors with the colors you want! (I suggest creating shared colors and using them across all chart components)
