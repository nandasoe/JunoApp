# Use wide-gamut (Display P3) colors everywhere

- **`Colorful`** is a styled Frame that allows you to use P3 colors for fill, shadow, and border. It also supports multi-step gradients, for those times where you really need to go crazy.

- **`MakeColorful`** connects to other elements on the canvas and converts all colors to P3, including nested children and graphics.

The components check for browser support, so the colors fall back to the default browser color space if it doesn't support P3.
