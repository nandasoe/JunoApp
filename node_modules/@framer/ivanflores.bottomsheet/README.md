# Bottom Sheet v2
Bottom Sheet is a component inspired on the bottom sheet view pattern that you can find in apps like Google Maps or Maps by Apple.

### New on the last version
üëâ **Overrides, Overrides everywhere!**  
Add the overrides code to move the sheet tapping  any other frame.  See instructions below.  

üëâ **It no longer blocks the UI below the sheet**  
When the sheet is not in the upper state (dim is not visible), it can interact with the elements in the back.
