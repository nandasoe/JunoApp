## Stateful Custom Button

Using only Framer X design tools, combine your **design frames** to create a **custom button** with **interactive states** including:

- **pressed** state (`:active`) for mouse & touch interactions
- **hover** state (`:hover`) for mouse interactions
- **focused** state (`:focus`) for keyboard interactions
- **disabled** state (`:disabled`)

All states except the Normal state are optional.

### Features

- Create reusable buttons that **resize automatically**.  
  - When the `StatefulButton` frame is resized, your button frames will be resized to follow.
- Set a **Link** on the button to transition to another frame on click.  
  - Place your `StatefulButton` inside of a new Frame of the same size.  Attach the Link to the wrapper frame.
- Set **Code Overrides** on the button to create custom click behaviors.  
  - Place your `StatefulButton` inside of a new Frame of the same size.  Set the Code Override (such as `Rotate` from the `Examples.tsx` overrides file) to the wrapper frame.  *Do not attach Code Overrides directly to the `StatefulButton` control.*

#### Limitations

- **Keyboard click behaviors** are not yet implemented due to Framer limitations.  You will not be able to trigger Code Overrides or Links using the keyboard. 
- **Overriding elements of your frames** is not supported.  This means that you cannot alter the text or icon inside the `StatefulButton` between instances.
  - **Workaround:** Place button text on top of the `StatefulButton` instead of inside your button masters.

#### Known issues

- When you **install or uninstall other components**, your button state frames will become detached.  You will need to reattach the button state frames.  This is a Framer X bug.
- On touch devices, the `:active` (**pressed**) state will get stuck if the user drags outside of the button area.
