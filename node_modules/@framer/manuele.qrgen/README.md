# QRGen

## Overview

QRGen is Framer component to easily generate QR codes built by [Manuele Capacci](https://manuelecapacci.com/)

QRGen is based on 'node-qrcode' npm module and exposes several configuration options.
You can choose a color for background and foreground and padding. As well as the QR Code symbol version, the error correction level, and mask pattern.

Size of the QRCode is derived from the component itself, so you can simply resize it an see the graphic change accordingly.
