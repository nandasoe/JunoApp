## Overview

A helper component that provides a visual interface (property controls) for nearly all animation properties in the Framer Library. Useful to explore how our Spring APIs work, which Easing presets we include and discovering new properties to play with. The component can easily be forked to provide animation controls for your own custom code components, too. 

**Preview** the component (and refresh after changes) to see the provided options applied to a basic rotate animation. If you have any questions, let know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benjaminnathan).
