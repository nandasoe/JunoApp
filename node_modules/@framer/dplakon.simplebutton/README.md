# This is a Simple Button!

There are 3 states: Default, Hover, and Mouse Down.

The button is interactive, so it functions as you would expect in preview mode.

Changing "Button State" displays the available options for the selected state. Everthing above this dropdown is global -- applies to all states -- everything below applies to each state.

Icons are set by a string in the "Icon" field. To access all Icons, use the names in the material design documentation:
[Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline)
