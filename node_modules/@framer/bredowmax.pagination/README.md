Building on Framerâ€™s very own PageComponent with the Cube transition, this component gives a quick access to the 3D cube transitions such as seen in Instagram Stories, with added control. The package includes two transitions I found the most useful: 3d cube & slideshow (none).

This component packages 3 options:
a) The standard Page component without controls
b) Buttons to navigate through pages
c) No swipe functionality, instead the user taps on a designated area.

Based on a version with Overrides by Josh Peters, with great help by Addison Schultz

ToDo:
Version d) that allows both to swipe and to tap.
